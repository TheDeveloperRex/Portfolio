# PROJECT INFORMATION

## WHAT IS GSC?
- In Call of Duty, "GSC" stands for "Game Script Code." GSC is a scripting language used in the Call of Duty series to program and control various aspects of gameplay, such as game mechanics, events, AI behavior, and more. It allows developers to create game modes, maps, and gameplay elements for the game. These scripts contain commands, functions, and variables that define how different elements of the game behave. Scripters can manipulate player movement, weapon behavior, game objectives, and other aspects of gameplay using GSC.
