# PROJECT INFORMATION

## WHAT IS GSC?
- In Call of Duty, "GSC" stands for "Game Script Code." GSC is a scripting language, derived from languages such as C++ and C#, used in the Call of Duty series to program and control various aspects of gameplay, such as game mechanics, events, AI behavior, and more. It allows developers to create game modes, maps, and gameplay elements for the game. These scripts contain commands, functions, and variables that define how different elements of the game behave. Scripters can manipulate player movement, weapon behavior, game objectives, and other aspects of gameplay using GSC.

## WHAT IS LUA?
- Lua is frequently employed to allow developers to customize and extend the game's UI. Game engines and frameworks may provide Lua scripting support specifically tailored for UI development, enabling designers and programmers to create interactive menus, HUDs (Heads-Up Displays), in-game notifications, and other UI elements.

### ORDA BOSS AI

[![ORDA BOSS AI](https://github.com/TheDeveloperRex/Portfolio/assets/101901578/3a8e0400-815e-4fe1-b1c1-629d3a04e35a)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVeXBQBfBUQ&t=75s&ab_channel=REX)


Used in many areas of the main project as a final enemy boss that must defeated to be rewarded greatly. It can be encountered it games such as Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War.
  * This AI is programmed using the GSC/CSC programming language.
  * Utilized 3D space directional vectors, advanced trigonometry and calculus.
  * Utilized data structures to store data in sub-variables on the AI to access certain attributes across multiple functions without the unnecessary reassignments.
  * Utilized advanced trigonometry, calculus, 3D directional vector math to handle displacement, complex angular rotations and movement.
  * Utilized Treyarch AI systems to allow the AI to perform specialized events and actions within the Call of Duty Zombies mode.
